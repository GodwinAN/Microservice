# Microservice (BMI Calculator)

Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice (MLOps or Data Engineering Focused)

Objectives
1. Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API
2. Push source code to Github
3. Configure Build System to Deploy changes
4. Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code
5. Use either AWS, Azure, GCP (recommended services include Google App Engine, AWS App Runner or Azure App Services)
6. Containerization is optional, but recommended


# Significance
Tracking your BMI is a useful way of checking if you’re maintaining a healthy weight. 
It’s calculated using a person's weight and height, using this formula: weight / height²

# Impementation
The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
Underweight = less than 18.5
Normal = more or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
Overweight = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
Obesity = 30 or more

# Solution
Let’s make finding out your BMI quicker and easier, by creating a program that takes a 
person's weight and height as input and outputs the corresponding BMI category.

# Sample Input
weight(kgs) = 85
Height(cms) = 150

# Sample Output
BMI: XX
Grade: Normal
